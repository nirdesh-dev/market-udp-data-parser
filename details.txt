Code Sample

Your task is to create a program, written in Rust, that will parse and print quote messages from a market data feed. When invoked with an -r flag, the program should re-order the messages according to the ‘quote accept time’ at the exchange. Take care to ensure it performs well (both in terms of wall time and memory usage), even when the input file is larger than available memory. The code should compile with with the latest stable rustc release.
Parsing the Market Data Feed

The relevant parts of the market data feed are sent via UDP broadcast to ports 15515/15516. For the purposes of this exercise, a standard pcap file is supplied which you will use to parse the UDP packets. Quote packets (specified below) begin with the ASCII bytes "B6034", and contain the five current best bids and asks on the market. Anything else should be ignored.

Your program should print the packet and quote accept times, the issue code, followed by the bids from 5th to 1st, then the asks from 1st to 5th; e.g.:

    $ ./parse-quote mdf-kospi200.20110216-0.pcap
    <pkt-time> <accept-time> <issue-code> <bqty5>@<bprice5> ... <bqty1>@<bprice1> <aqty1>@<aprice1> ... <aqty5>@<aprice5>
    ...

Reordering on Quote Accept Time

The delay between the exchange accepting the quote and us receiving the packet fluctuates for a variety of reasons; we may even receive the packets out of order. Given an optional flag -r, your program should output the messages ordered by the quote accept time.

You should assume that the difference between the quote accept time and the pcap packet time is never more than 3 seconds.
